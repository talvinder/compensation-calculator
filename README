# SaaS Compensation Calculator

This project is a **SaaS Compensation Calculator** designed to calculate the compensation of employees (including equity, base salary, and bonuses) based on their performance relative to revenue benchmarks. The calculator is built using **Streamlit**, a Python-based web app framework that allows for easy interaction and visualization.

### Designed for B2B SaaS Products

This tool is specifically designed for **B2B SaaS products** where the employees are **based in India** but the product is sold in the **USA**. It handles the complexity of exchange rates (USD to INR), varying revenue targets, and compensation structures that reward performance.

## Features

- **Two Bonus Calculation Methods:**
  - **Proportional Bonus:** Calculates a bonus proportional to the revenue achieved relative to the target.
  - **Excess Revenue Bonus:** Rewards performance exceeding target revenue with an additional bonus based on the surplus revenue.
  
- **Equity Calculation:** Based on performance levels (Median, Top Quartile, Top Decile), employees can earn equity with growth rates determining the progression between these levels.

- **Visualization:** Graphically compares actual revenue against performance benchmarks (Median, Top Quartile, and Top Decile).

- **Interactive Inputs:** Allows for adjusting parameters like base salary, exchange rates, bonus percentages, and revenue targets directly through the sidebar.

- **Download Results:** Generates a downloadable Excel report with compensation results, including a graph for performance comparison.

## How It Works

### Input Parameters

1. **Base Salary and Bonus Parameters**:
   - Set your base salary in lakhs INR.
   - Adjust the **bonus base percentage** (e.g., 125%) and the **excess bonus percentage** (e.g., 10%) to reflect company bonus policies.

2. **Revenue Targets**:
   - Enter the actual revenue for each year.
   - Set performance benchmarks (Median, Top Quartile, Top Decile) for each year based on your company's revenue projections. These benchmarks are based on the **ChartMogul SaaS Growth Report** [found here](https://chartmogul.com/reports/saas-growth-report/).

3. **Equity Levels**:
   - Equity is determined based on the company's performance relative to benchmarks and grows at user-defined growth rates.

4. **Bonus Calculation Methods**:
   - **Proportional Bonus:** A linear bonus based on performance relative to the target revenue.
   - **Excess Revenue Bonus:** An additional bonus if actual revenue exceeds the target.

### Outputs

1. **Base Salary**: The base salary grows yearly by a fixed percentage.
2. **Proportional Bonus**: A bonus based on a proportional increase in revenue relative to the target.
3. **Excess Revenue Bonus**: An additional reward for performance exceeding target revenue, calculated using the exchange rate and the excess revenue.
4. **Equity**: Based on performance levels (Median, Top Quartile, Top Decile), and user-defined growth rates.
5. **Total Compensation**: The final compensation, including salary, bonus (both types), and equity.

### Visualization
The app generates a performance chart comparing actual revenue against benchmarks, allowing you to visualize how performance translates into bonuses and equity.

### Example Calculation
- **Base Salary:** ₹65 lakhs
- **Target Revenue:** $1.875M (Top Quartile benchmark)
- **Actual Revenue:** $2M
- **Excess Bonus Percentage:** 10%

In this case:
- **Proportional Bonus**: ₹86.46 lakhs
- **Excess Revenue Bonus**: ₹91.625 lakhs

Both calculation methods can be compared to see which one provides the best reward for the employee based on actual performance.

### How to Run the App

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/saas-compensation-calculator.git
   cd saas-compensation-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. **Adjust Parameters:** Open the app in your browser, and use the sidebar to adjust the input parameters (salary, bonus, revenue, etc.).

### Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Data Integration:** Fetch revenue and financial data directly from business tools.
- **Multi-Year Projections:** Generate compensation projections across multiple years with real-time adjustments.
- **Team-Level Reports:** Calculate compensation for entire teams and departments.
